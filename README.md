# PGITSound

1 starts the first song. Pressing 1 again will go to the next song and pressing 2 will go to the previous song.

3 is used for fading. If you press 3 it will fade the song out. Press 1 or 2 to go to a different song. 

You can change any of this in the main body of code outlined by CONTROLS MUSIC or CONTROLS FOLEY.

There's only one case for Foley which is 'q', however there's no sound effects in it. 

To add other sounds, add them to the data folder and add the name od the file to the indicated place at the top of the main body.

e.g. foley = {"bg1.mp3"};
